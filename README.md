Hi,

I ran a customer churn prediction model using 3 different machine learning algorithms on Python.

I wanted to identify the model that is most accurate for this specific problem. I am working on finding ways to improve the accuracy of these models. Here are my findings. 

<u>Models Used</u> 
1) K-Nearest Neighbor - 84.45 Accuracy (K = 14)
2) AdaBoost Classification - 85.4 Accuracy (100 Estimators)
3) Random Forest Classification - 86.9 Accuracy (128 Estimators)

I have also uploaded the dataset, if anyone wants to try and replicate the problem on their end.
